# Inventory-Program
WMC Inventory Program


This program was created to replace a pre existing solution and is in no way perfect. 

Current roadmap for what needs added and fixed
  1. Automatic focus based on number of characters in the entry field for Checkin/Checkout/User Creation windows
  2. Better UI
  3. Better logging infastructure, json is not it fam.


Things that currently work
  1. UI and elements to add to DB (though they are rough)
  2. Viewing information on currently checked in and checked out inventory
  3. Being able to add and subtract inventory from checked in / checked out
  
Please test this out and break it so that I can fix anything you come across, log any notes and submit them to my work email.
